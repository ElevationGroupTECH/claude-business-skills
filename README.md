# Greg's Business Skills

**Most people use Claude like it's the cleaning lady next door. These skills turn it into your project manager.**

</td>
</tr></table>

Ever started a new project and spent 20 minutes explaining context to Claude — only to do it all over again next session? Or opened a project folder after two weeks and had zero clue where you left off?

Whether you know the type or you ARE the type: 147 files on the desktop. "Final_v3_FINAL_really-final.docx". A project folder that looks like a digital junk drawer. No judgment — we've all been there.

Here's the thing: **Claude is only as good as the context you give it.** That's called context engineering — and it's the difference between an AI that calls you "Hugo" and one that knows your project better than you do.

These skills are automated context engineering. You talk for 30 seconds, and Claude has a project structure that still works after weeks and months. No context loss. No "Where were we again?". Even with large projects.

## Greg's Project Cockpit 🎯

**Start projects right. Keep them right.**

Your first skill bundle. Two skills that belong together like inhaling and exhaling:

```
   /project-kickoff                    /project-review
   ┌──────────────┐                   ┌──────────────┐
   │  START RIGHT  │ ──→ Work ──→    │  STAY RIGHT   │
   │              │                   │              │
   │  Structure   │                   │  Score       │
   │  Description │                   │  Fix         │
   │  Changelog   │                   │  Polish      │
   │  CLAUDE.md   │                   │  Celebrate   │
   └──────────────┘                   └──────────────┘
          ↑                                  │
          └──────── Keep working ←───────────┘
```

**`/project-kickoff`** sets up a clean foundation. **`/project-review`** keeps it clean as the project grows. Without review, every project turns into a jungle. Without a good kickoff, there's nothing worth reviewing.

Install both. Your future self will thank you.

## Installation

```bash
# Add the skill marketplace (one time)
/plugin marketplace add ElevationGroupTECH/gregs-business-skills

# Install Greg's Project Cockpit
/plugin install project-kickoff     # English
/plugin install project-review      # English

# Oder auf Deutsch
/plugin install projekt-starten     # Deutsch
/plugin install projekt-review      # Deutsch
```

Then just run `/project-kickoff` or `/project-review` in any Claude Code session.

## The Skills

### `/project-kickoff` — Start Projects Right

Turn a chaotic brain dump into a properly structured project. You talk, Claude organizes:

- **Project description** with all the details that matter (goals, people, timeline, tech stack)
- **Changelog** with phases, milestones, task tracking, and log entries
- **CLAUDE.md** so Claude knows exactly what to read and how to behave in your project
- **Smart sizing** — small projects stay flat, large ones get letter-prefixed docs + numbered subfolders
- **Verification** — three targeted questions to make sure nothing was lost in translation
- **Perspective shift check** — step out of creator mode, look at your project through your customer's eyes

**How it works:** Run `/project-kickoff`, dump everything you know about your project (voice message style is fine — messy, unstructured, all over the place), and watch Claude turn it into a pristine project structure in under a minute.

### `/project-review` — Polish Check (Score Your Project)

Your project has been growing for weeks. Files everywhere. The changelog is three updates behind. The CLAUDE.md still mentions Phase 1 when you're deep in Phase 3.

This skill runs a comprehensive review and gives you a **Polish Score out of 10**:

| Category | What It Checks |
|---|---|
| 🏗️ **Structure** | CLAUDE.md, file naming, folder hierarchy |
| 📋 **Completeness** | Project description, tasks, milestones, changelog |
| 🔗 **Consistency** | Cross-references, URLs, phase names, status indicators |
| 🕐 **Currency** | Are statuses up to date? Is the changelog current? |
| 🧹 **Cleanliness** | Temp files, orphaned docs, overgrown files |

**What happens:**
1. Full assessment (reads everything, checks everything)
2. Automatic fixes (sort order, log index, file overview — the obvious stuff)
3. Decision table (things that need your input)
4. Recommended tasks with priority and score impact
5. Score forecast: "If you do all of this → 9.2 / 10"

**The score scale:**
```
0-1: 🤯  |  1-2: 🤬  |  2-3: 😱  |  3-4: 😫  |  4-5: 🥵
5-6: 🧐  |  6-7: 🤔  |  7-8: 😀  |  8-9: 🤩💪  |  9-10: 🏆🏆🏆
```

Hit 9+? You get a celebration. You've earned it.

## Who Is This For?

- **Coaches & consultants** managing client projects, course launches, or event planning
- **Marketers** juggling campaigns, content calendars, and website projects
- **Solo entrepreneurs** who need structure but don't have a project manager
- **Anyone using Claude Code** who wants their AI to actually remember what's going on

If you've ever reopened a Claude conversation and spent 10 minutes re-explaining your project — these skills fix that. Permanently.

## A Word of Honesty

These skills aren't magic. They won't fix a project that has no clear goal, and they won't replace thinking about what you're actually building. What they will do is remove the friction of setting up and maintaining the boring-but-essential project scaffolding — so you can focus on the work that matters.

They're the skills we use daily. Battle-tested, not perfect. And completely free.

---

## Languages

Every skill is available in **English** and **German**:

| English | Deutsch | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/project-kickoff` | `/projekt-starten` | Set up a new project with proper structure |
| `/project-review` | `/projekt-review` | Score and polish an existing project |

## About

Built by **[Teile Deine Botschaft](https://www.teiledeinebotschaft.de)** (TDB). These skills come from Gregor Dorsch — structure nerd, context engineering obsessive, and the kind of person who'd rather spend 2 hours perfecting a CLAUDE.md than 20 minutes working in a messy project.

Structure is king for context engineering. And these skills are Greg's way of automating that for everyone.

> *Built from hundreds of hours of real project work with Claude. Not theory — this is how we actually work every day.*
