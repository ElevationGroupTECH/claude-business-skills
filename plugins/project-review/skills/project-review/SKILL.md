# Project Review — Polish Check

This skill brings a grown project back to a polished state. Projects grow over time like an untrimmed tree — files accumulate, structures erode, changelogs drift apart, clutter piles up. This review takes a bird's-eye view of the project, autonomously fixes what's obvious, and suggests everything else as concrete tasks.

The skill always refers to the project folder you're currently working in. The benchmark is the project structure from `/project-kickoff`.

---

## Phase 0: Orientation — Where Am I?

Before anything happens: **Make sure we're in the right project folder.**

1. **Check the current folder:**
   - Is there a `CLAUDE.md`? Are there project files (01-Project-Description... or A - Project-Description...)?
   - If yes → Project recognized, continue with Phase 1
   - If no → Ask: "Which project folder should I review?"

2. **If an argument was passed** (path): Use it.

3. **Identify project type:**
   - Numbered root files (01-, 02-...) → **Small project** (flat structure)
   - Letter prefix (A -, B -, C -...) + numbered folders → **Large project**
   - Neither → Note as a finding

---

## Phase 1: Assessment — What Do We Have?

First build a complete picture, **before** changing anything.

### Layer 1: CLAUDE.md

Read and check the CLAUDE.md:

- **Does it exist?** If not → critical finding
- **Is it concise enough?** Target: under 80 lines. Anything longer wastes context window.
- **Is the file overview accurate?** Are all existing project files listed?
- **Are the rules correct?** Do they reference the right files? Are paths correct?
- **Is there a project review rule?** (After 10 tasks → review)
- **Is there a Context Compact rule?** (After compact → re-read project description + changelog)
- **Is it current?** Does the description still match the actual project state?

### Layer 2: Project Files (Content)

Read all root documents (01/02/03... or A/B/C...) and check:

**Project Description (01 or A):**
- Is it complete? (Title, overview, people, audience, timeline, file structure)
- Is it current? Does it still match the actual project progress?
- Are there contradictions with the actual state?

**Tasks/Changelog (02 or B+C):**
- Are task statuses current?
- Are tasks cleanly numbered? (Continuous numbering, no gaps, no duplicates)
- Is the sort order correct? (✅ top → 🔄 → ⬜ → ⚙️ → ◆ bottom)
- Are the phases still sensible?
- Are the milestones still relevant and current?
- **Log Index:** Is it complete?
- **Changelog:** Chronologically correct (newest first)?

**Decision Log (if present):**
- Is the index current?
- Are decisions documented with rationale?
- **Reality check:** Do decisions still reflect the current state?

**Cross-Reference Check (systematic):**

- **URLs:** Every URL appearing in more than one file → verify consistency.
- **File names and paths:** Do references match the file system?
- **Phase names and prefixes:** Are the same names used everywhere?
- **Status indicators:** Are they consistent across all files?
- **People and roles:** Are team members named consistently?

For every contradiction: Identify the source of truth and note all other locations as findings.

**Additional Project Files:**
- Are they still relevant? Or outdated?
- Are there content duplications between files?
- Are there contradictions between files?
- Are file names descriptive and correctly versioned (V01, V02...)?

### Layer 3: Folders and File Structure

- **List all folders** and briefly look inside
- **Check xold/:**
  - Are there true duplicates?
  - Are there extremely large files just wasting space?
  - DON'T delete based on age alone!
- **Orphaned files:** Files referenced nowhere?
- **Temporary files:** `.tmp`, `.bak`, lock files, etc.
- **Does the folder structure fit the project?**
- **Overgrown files:** Files >300 lines that should be split?

---

## Phase 2: Immediate Fixes — What's Obvious?

After the assessment: Fix everything that's clearly wrong and can be corrected risk-free:

- **Fix sort order:** Tasks in the right sequence (✅ → 🔄 → ⬜ → ⚙️ → ◆)
- **Complete log index:** Add missing entries
- **Update CLAUDE.md file overview:** Add missing files, remove non-existent ones
- **Close numbering gaps**
- **Fix obvious typos** in project files
- **Remove temporary files**
- **Move empty or useless files** to xold/
- **Fix chronology:** Put changelog in correct order (newest first)

**DON'T do yourself** (suggest only):
- Rename files that are referenced elsewhere
- Restructure the project
- Merge or split phases
- Rewrite or shorten content
- Delete files from xold/
- Split the project

### Polish Score: [X.X] / 10  [EMOJI]

| Category | Score | Details |
|---|---|---|
| 🏗️ **Structure** | [X.X] / 2.0 | [1 sentence] |
| 📋 **Completeness** | [X.X] / 2.0 | [1 sentence] |
| 🔗 **Consistency** | [X.X] / 2.0 | [1 sentence] |

```

**The 5 Categories in Detail:**

**🏗️ Structure** (max 2.0) — The skeleton: Does the right form exist?
- CLAUDE.md present, concise enough (<80 lines), rules correct?
- Project type recognizable? Files named correctly?
- Folder hierarchy sensible? xold/ present?

**📋 Completeness** (max 2.0) — The substance: Is all content there?
- Project description complete?
- Tasks with phases, milestones, numbering?
- Changelog with log index and log entries?

**🔗 Consistency** (max 2.0) — The logic: Does nothing contradict?
- URLs, phase names, file references consistent everywhere?
- Decisions reflect current state?

**🕐 Currency** (max 2.0) — The freshness: Is everything up to date?
- Task statuses match reality?
- Changelog documents all completed work?

**🧹 Cleanliness** (max 2.0) — The hygiene: Is there clutter?
- xold/ tidy? No temp artifacts?
- No orphaned files? No monster files (>300 lines)?

**Overall Scale:**

## Phase 4: Next Steps

1. **Ask if tasks should be executed:**
   > "These are the issues I found. Should I tackle them now? Or would you like to discuss specific ones first?"

2. **If approved:** Work through tasks in order.

3. **Update changelog:**
   ```
   ### LOG-XXX — [DATE] — Project Review (Polish)
   - Review completed: [count] findings, [X] fixed immediately
   - Polish Score: [before] → [after]
   ```

4. **If score reaches 9+ → Celebrate the polish achievement!**

   The celebration should be fun, vivid, and motivating — referencing concrete improvements made during the review.

## Key Principles

- **Bird's-eye view, not ant's-eye view:** Don't dive into code. Only check the project framework.
- **Understand first, act second:** Read everything completely before changing anything.
- **Conservative with deletions:** Rather move to xold/ than delete.
- **The goal is polish:** After the review, the project should feel freshly set up.
- **No over-engineering:** Keep the project lean, not bloated.
