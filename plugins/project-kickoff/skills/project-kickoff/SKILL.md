# Project Kickoff

This skill sets up a new project properly — with a project description, changelog, CLAUDE.md, and clean structure. No more "New Folder (47)" and file chaos.

---

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Determine Project Folder

1. **Ask for the project folder:**
   - Was a path passed as an argument? → Use it
   - Otherwise: "Where should this project live? Give me a path, or tell me where it fits thematically (e.g., Marketing, Products, Clients), and I'll suggest a location."
   - If the folder doesn't exist yet: Create it (after confirmation)

2. **Navigate to the project folder** and work there.

---

### Phase 2: Understand the Project (Briefing)

This is the most important step. Users will typically send a **voice message** — unstructured, all over the place, with tangents. That's normal and expected!

3. **Tell the user:**
   > "Tell me about your project! Just talk freely — jumping around is totally fine. I'll organize it for you. Tell me:
   > - What kind of project is this? (Book, conference, course, workshop, marketing campaign, software, ...)
   > - Who is it for? (Target audience)
   > - What's the goal?
   > - Who's involved? (Team, partners, clients...)
   > - Is there existing work? (Concept docs, existing files...)
   > - Are there deadlines or a timeline?
   > - What tools/platforms are being used?
   >
   > If you already have files (concepts, notes), just tell me where they are — I'll read them in."

4. **When the user responds:** Take everything in, even if it's chaotic. DON'T interrupt. Only summarize in a structured way once they're done.

5. **If the user references existing files** (e.g., a concept document): Read them in and use them as a foundation.

---

### Phase 3: Ask Clarifying Questions

6. **Ask clarifying questions** — only what's truly missing or unclear. Typical gaps:
   - Project title (if not mentioned)
   - Target audience details
   - People involved and their roles
   - Technical platform / tools
   - Budget or resources (only if relevant)

   **Don't ask too many questions at once!** Maximum 3-5 questions that are truly necessary.

7. **Ask about milestones:**
   > "Are there clear milestones or phases? A milestone is a measurable outcome that closes a phase — e.g., 'Manuscript done', 'Site live', 'Campaign launched'. If you have phases, we'll define a milestone for each."

   Milestones are displayed with ◆ (diamond) and visualized:
   ```
   ◆ M1: Manuscript complete             ✅ done
   │
   ◆ M2: Cover + layout approved         🔄 in progress
   │
   ◆ M3: Book published                  ⬜ open
   ```

8. **Determine project size:**
   > "Is this a small or large project?"

   **Small** = Workshop, single campaign, manageable scope, few files expected
   **Large** = Book, conference, course with many modules, software — many files from different areas

   When in doubt: **Start small.** You can always expand later.

---

### Phase 4: Create Project Structure

Once enough information is gathered, create these files:

#### Required files (always):

##### Small Project: Numbered Files

```
[project-folder]/
├── CLAUDE.md
├── 01-Project-Description-[NAME]-V01.md
├── 02-Changelog-[NAME].md
├── 03-[Additional-File]-V01.md
├── ...
└── xold/
```

##### Large Project: Letter Prefix for Root Documents + Numbered Subfolders

In large projects with thematic subfolders, numbered root files (01-, 02-) clash with numbered folders. Solution: **Letter prefix** for root documents, numbers for subfolders.

```
[project-folder]/
├── CLAUDE.md
├── A - Project-Description-[NAME]-V01.md    ← Always read
├── B - Tasks-[NAME].md                      ← Always read
├── C - Changelog-[NAME].md                  ← Read log index
├── D - [Additional-File].md
├── E - [Additional-File].md
├── F - Decisions-[NAME].md                  ← Optional
├── 01-[thematic-folder]/
├── 02-[thematic-folder]/
├── ...
└── xold/
```

**Rule:** Letter files (A, B, C...) are the documents Claude reads at every conversation start. Numbers (01-, 02-...) are for subfolders.

---

#### a) Project Description (01 or A)

   Contents:
   - Project title
   - Overview (What? For whom? Why?)
   - People involved (names, roles)
   - Project type (own project, client project, joint venture...)
   - Target audience
   - Format / scope
   - Platform / tech stack
   - Timeline / deadlines
   - File structure (what's in the folder)
   - Next steps

#### b) Tasks & Changelog

For **small projects** everything is in one file (`02-Changelog`). For **large projects** it's split into two files:

##### Small Project: One File (02-Changelog)

Contains everything: task tables, milestones, log index, logs.

```
# Changelog: [PROJECT NAME]

> **Legend:**
> - 📄 = Page task (creating/revising a page)
> - ⚙️ = Code review / Technical task
> - ◆ = Milestone
> No icon = general task

## Tasks by Phase

### Phase 1 — [PHASE NAME]

> Status: 🔄 In Progress

| Nr | Task | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [PRE]-01 | 📄 Create homepage | ✅ Done |
| [PRE]-02 | Configure robots.txt | ⬜ Open |
| [PRE]-03 | ⚙️ Code review Phase 1 | ⬜ Open |
| ◆ | **Milestone: [MEASURABLE OUTCOME]** | ⬜ Open |

## Milestones (Overview)

◆ M1: [Description]     ✅ done
│
◆ M2: [Description]     🔄 in progress

## Log Index (Quick Overview)

| Log | Date | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| LOG-001 | [DATE] | Project start — Setup, structure, CLAUDE.md |

## Changelog (newest first!)

### LOG-001 — [DATE] — Project Start
- Project created and structured
```

##### Large Project: Two Separate Files (B + C)

**`B - Tasks-[NAME].md`** — What's ahead? (Planning)
**`C - Changelog-[NAME].md`** — What was done? (History)

##### Rules for Both Variants

   **Task Numbers:** Each phase gets a 3-4 letter prefix (e.g., LIVE, PROUD, GROW).

   **Phase Prefixes:** Choose positive, motivating ones! The prefix accompanies every task — it should feel good. Examples: LIVE, PROUD, GROW, START, GLOW.

   **Page Tasks** (📄): When a task involves creating or revising a page/document.
   **Code Review** (⚙️): Plan a complete review as a task after EVERY phase.

   **Sort order within a phase:** Tasks are sorted by status:
   1. ✅ Done (top)
   2. 🔄 In Progress / V1
   3. ⬜ Open
   4. ⚙️ Code Review / Review
   5. ◆ Milestone (always last row)

   **RULES for the changelog:**
   - **REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL:** Newest log entries go on TOP, oldest at BOTTOM
   - **Log numbers:** Format `LOG-XXX` (e.g., LOG-001, LOG-002)
   - **Maintain log index:** Update the log index after EVERY new log entry

#### c) Decision Log (optional, recommended for larger projects)

```
# Decisions — [PROJECT NAME]

> Newest first, oldest last.

## Decision Index

| Nr | Date | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| D-001 | [DATE] | [Short description] |

## Decisions (newest first)

### D-001 — [DATE] — [Title]

**Decision:** [What was decided?]
**Rationale:** [Why?]
**Impact:** [What changes as a result?]
```

#### d) CLAUDE.md (in the project folder)

   Contents:
   - Project name and one-line description
   - People involved
   - File overview (what's where)
   - **Rule: At every conversation start** read project description AND changelog
   - Give a brief summary and suggest next 2-3 to-dos
   - After each completed step, immediately update the changelog
   - After Context Compact: Re-read project description and changelog
   - **NEVER delete files**, move them to `xold/` instead
   - **Project review rule:** Conduct a project review after every 10 completed tasks

#### e) `xold/` — Archive folder (always create)

---

### Sizing: Small vs. Large

#### Small Project (flat structure)

All files directly in the project folder. No subfolders except `xold/`. Numbered with digits.

**When small?** Workshop, single campaign, manageable scope. When fewer than ~15 files are expected.

**Rule:** Expand only when needed. New topics = new numbered file. Only consider a subfolder when an area has >5 files.

#### Large Project (letters + subfolders)

Root documents with **letter prefix** (A, B, C...), subfolders with **numbers** (01-, 02-...). Tasks and changelog are **separated**.

**When large?** Book, conference, course with many modules, software.

**Typical subfolders by project type:**

| Project Type | Subfolders |
|-------------|------------|
| Online Conference | 01-Positioning, 02-Images, 03-Speakers, 04-Tech, 05-Marketing |
| Book | 01-Manuscript, 02-Approvals, 03-Cover, 04-Marketing |
| Online Course | 01-Curriculum, 02-Videos, 03-Materials, 04-Tech |
| Marketing Campaign | 01-Strategy, 02-Content, 03-Ads, 04-Analysis |
| Software / Website | 01-Requirements, 02-Design, 03-Documentation |

Suggest subfolders to the user and get confirmation. Don't over-engineer!

---

### Phase 5: Verification (Three-Question Technique)

9. **Show the user the result:**
   - Briefly summarize what was created
   - List the file structure

10. **Ask three questions:**
    > "To make sure I understood everything correctly, here are three questions:"
    >
    > [Ask three project-specific questions that verify the project was correctly understood]

11. **Make improvement suggestions:**
    > "Is there anything else you should consider? Here are my suggestions: [...]"

12. **Wrap up:**
    > "The project is set up! You can come back to this folder anytime and continue working. I'll automatically read the CLAUDE.md and know exactly where we left off."

---

## Project Review (for larger projects)

**When?** Conduct a complete project review after every **10 completed tasks**. The CLAUDE.md should contain this rule.

**What gets checked:**

1. **Changelog up to date?** Are all status indicators correct? Are all logs recorded?
2. **Duplications?** Is information maintained in multiple places that could drift apart?
3. **Structure still appropriate?** Has the project evolved in ways that make folders/files no longer fit?
4. **Documentation complete?** Can you still find everything you need?
5. **Clean?** Are there outdated files that belong in `xold/`?
6. **CLAUDE.md current?** Are paths, file overview, and rules still correct?

**Result:** Log entry with findings + cleanup actions if needed.

---

## Important Rules

- **Start small:** When in doubt, use a flat structure. Add subfolders when needed.
- **Versioning:** New version = new number (V01, V02, ...), never overwrite
- **xold folder:** Move old files here instead of deleting
- **Language:** English (default), German only if explicitly requested
- **Don't over-engineer:** Only create what's needed. Better to start lean and expand as needed.
